# 03
An experiment with two types of threads - producers and consumers.

## shared.py
Contains an implementation of a class representing a shared storage space, in which producers store produced items
and from which consumers retrieve said items.

## producerconsumer.py
Preparation for an experiment where the intention was to track the relationship between the number of producers and consumers,
where possible values for both numbers are [10, 20, 30, 40], and the amount of production/consumption pairs in a given unit of time.
Originally intended to plot and interpret the results, however due to a lack of time, the experiment unfortunately had to be cancelled.
